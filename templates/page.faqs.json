If left untreated, the wood will eventually turn a gray\/silver color from the sun but this will not affect the function of the sauna in any way. If you want to preserve the sauna’s deep, natural color, you should use a clear UV-inhibited stain on the exterior to protect it from the damaging effects of rain and sunlight.

            "answer": "<p>When we expose our bodies to infrared light, our bodies' metabolic process accelerates. As the body heats up to a slight fever of 99.0 degrees, the temperature at which our bodies begin to fight infection, we begin to sweat, resulting in a passive cardiovascular workout as the body attempts to cool itself naturally. The heart will have to work harder to help cool the skin's surface, and you will begin to breathe more heavily as your body requires you to oxygenate the blood pumped at a higher rate throughout your body. Sweating is an essential factor. Toxins that the body cannot ordinarily pass through the kidneys or liver are present in 20% of all perspiration produced during an infrared sauna session. In contrast, only 3% of your sweat in a traditional or steam sauna is toxins removed from the body.<\/p>"

            "question": "Why do steam and dry heat saunas not remove as many toxins from the body as infrared saunas?",
            "answer": "<p>Steam and dry saunas operate on a principle known as convention. It heats the air first, then the body, just like an oven. An infrared sauna operates on the radiant heat theory. The infrared rays penetrate the muscle tissue removing toxins directly from deep within the muscle and the subcutaneous layer of fat via our skin. When exposed to infrared light, cancer cells with a heat shock protein of 70 or less perish. Residual or latent viruses, germs, and toxins from chemotherapy, lead, mercury, uranium, pesticides, drug misuse, nicotine, and alcohol are released via the skin, relieving the body of the task of keeping these dangerous toxins away from essential organs.<\/p>"

You can never overdose on infrared light since your body can only absorb enough for each cell before it passes harmlessly out of the body.

Near infrared has the shortest wavelength and penetrates the skin the least, but it can help to improve circulation and reduce inflammation. Mid-infrared has a longer wavelength and penetrates the skin deeper than near infrared, but not as deep as far infrared. It can help to relieve pain and promote relaxation. Far infrared has the longest wavelength and penetrates skin the deepest, reaching the muscles and organs. It can help to increase circulation, reduce inflammation, and boost the immune system. A far infrared sauna only emits far infrared light. This type of sauna is typically more efficient at heating the body’s core temperature than a full spectrum sauna, but it may not offer the same range of health benefits.<\/p>"

All saunas have a built in water proof floor heater so you do not have to worry about it leaking on carpeting for example. All of the electronics are on the roof of the sauna so if you decide to put it outside, you must make sure it is under a covered patio\/roof. Please note that since these are meant for indoors, putting it outside will void the warranty and you will be responsible for payment on any replacement part you will need. Depending on the environment, it will also take your infrared longer to heat up if it is outside. We do offer custom canvas covers for your sauna.

Saunas are only on when in use, and off when not being used so you are not drawing power.

            "answer": "<p>Infrared saunas and traditional saunas both use heat to promote relaxation and other health benefits. However, they do so in different ways. Infrared saunas use infrared light to heat the body directly. This light penetrates the skin and warms the tissues beneath, which can help to improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain. Infrared saunas operate at a lower temperature than traditional saunas. Traditional saunas heat the air, which then heats the body. The option of adding water to the rocks creates humidity in the traditional sauna.<\/p>"

The wood is heated to a high temperature, typically between 180 and 220 degrees Celsius, in an oxygen-free environment. This process changes the chemical structure of the wood, making it a better quality wood. The Thermory process also cooks the sugars out of the wood making it more stable, long lasting - it doesn't attract bugs or mold because sugars are gone and it looks better as it ages (more even coloring). Each board is checked with x-ray and the defective ones are discarded. Because of the Thermory process you also don’t have to adjust the metal bands as much because the wood is more stable and doesn't shrink\/expand as much as other saunas.<\/p>"
